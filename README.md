# PhotoSort: Intelligent Photo Library Management

PhotoSort is a powerful desktop application focused on speed designed to streamline the management of large photo libraries, making it easier than ever to sort, cull, and organize your images.

**Warning - Use this at your personal risk. Always use backups.**

## Key Features

* **Advanced Sorting & Viewing**:
  * Flexible view modes: List, Icons, Grid, and Chronological by Date.
  * **Real-time Search**: Instantly filter images by filename with live search results.
* **Intelligent Culling Tools**:
  * **Ratings & Labels**: Assign star ratings and color labels for quick categorization.
  * **Blur Detection**: Automatically identify and flag blurry photos.
  * **Similarity Analysis**: Group visually similar images to easily spot duplicates or near-duplicates.
* **Efficient Workflow**:
  * **Advanced Filtering System**:
    * Filter images by ratings (Show All, 1+ Stars, 2+ Stars, etc.)
    * Filter by similarity clusters when grouping is active
    * Combine text search with rating and cluster filters
    * Real-time filtering with immediate visual feedback
  * **Fast Processing**: Intensive operations (scanning, thumbnailing, analysis) run once in batch to ensure fast image scrolling.
  * **Optimized Image Handling**: Supports a wide range of formats, including various RAW types, with efficient caching.
* **File Management**:
  * Move unwanted photos to the system trash.
  * **Intelligent Image Rotation**: Smart rotation system that automatically tries lossless metadata rotation first, with optional fallback to pixel rotation when needed. Supports all major formats with format-specific optimization.

### Sidebar Features

The sidebar provides quick access to image metadata and organizational tools:

- **Metadata Display**: Shows detailed EXIF information (camera model, exposure settings, etc.) and user-assigned ratings/labels for the currently selected image.

## Technology Stack

* **Core Language**: Python
* **GUI Framework**: PyQt6
* **Image Processing**:
  * Pillow (PIL Fork)
  * rawpy (for RAW image processing)
  * OpenCV (cv2 - for blur detection via Laplacian variance)
  * pyexiv2 (for metadata reading/writing and image rotation)
* **Machine Learning / AI**:
  * SentenceTransformers (with CLIP models like `clip-ViT-B-32` for image embeddings)
  * scikit-learn (for DBSCAN clustering)
  * NumPy (for numerical operations)
  * ONNX Runtime (for AI model inference)
* **Packaging/Misc**:
  * `send2trash` (for moving files to trash)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **Python 3.x**: Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
* **jpegtran (Optional, for Lossless JPEG Rotation)**:
  * **Windows**: Download from [jpegclub.org](http://jpegclub.org/jpegtran/) or install via Chocolatey: `choco install libjpeg-turbo`
  * **macOS**: `brew install jpeg-turbo`
  * **Linux**: `sudo apt-get install libjpeg-turbo-progs` (Ubuntu/Debian) or `sudo yum install libjpeg-turbo-utils` (RedHat/CentOS)

### Hardware Acceleration (Optional, Recommended)

For significantly faster AI-powered features like **Rotation Detection** and **Similarity Analysis**, it is highly recommended to install the appropriate ONNX Runtime package for your hardware. The application will automatically use the best available hardware (GPU > CPU).

First, uninstall the basic CPU package to avoid conflicts:

```bash
pip uninstall onnxruntime
```

Then, install the package corresponding to your hardware:

#### For NVIDIA GPUs (CUDA)

```bash
# Requires NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit & cuDNN
pip install onnxruntime-gpu
```

#### For Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)

```bash
# Uses Apple's Metal Performance Shaders (MPS)
pip install onnxruntime-silicon
```

#### For AMD GPUs (ROCm) - Untested

```bash
# Requires AMD ROCm driver/libraries
pip install onnxruntime-rocm
```

### AI Model Setup (Required for Rotation Detection)

To use the **Auto Rotate Images** feature (`Ctrl+R`), you need to download the pre-trained orientation detection model.

1.  **Create a `models` directory** in the root of the project.
2.  **Download the model file**:
    *   **Link**: [Download orientation_model_v2_0.9882.onnx from Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/DuarteBarbosa/deep-image-orientation-detection/tree/main)
3.  **Place the downloaded model file inside the `models` directory.**

The application will automatically detect and load the model when you use the rotation detection feature.

### Installation & Running

1. **Clone the repository (if applicable):**

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   cd PhotoSort
   ```
2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   Ensure your [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) is up-to-date with all necessary packages (PyQt6, Pillow, rawpy, opencv-python, sentence-transformers, scikit-learn, numpy, send2trash, pyexiv2, onnxruntime).

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Run the application:**
   The main entry point is [`src/main.py`](src/main.py).

   ```bash
   python -m src.main [--folder FOLDER_PATH] [--clear-cache]

   # Examples:
   #   Open a specific folder at startup:
   #       python -m src.main --folder "C:/Users/MyUser/Pictures"
   #   Clear all caches before starting:
   #       python -m src.main --clear-cache
   #   Open folder and clear caches:
   #       python -m src.main --folder "C:/Users/MyUser/Pictures" --clear-cache
   ```

### Exporting Logs

To capture detailed logs for debugging, you can enable file logging by setting an environment variable before running the application.

*   **macOS/Linux**:
    ```bash
    export PHOTOSORT_ENABLE_FILE_LOGGING=true
    python -m src.main
    ```
*   **Windows (Command Prompt)**:
    ```bash
    set PHOTOSORT_ENABLE_FILE_LOGGING=true
    python -m src.main
    ```
*   **Windows (PowerShell)**:
    ```powershell
    $env:PHOTOSORT_ENABLE_FILE_LOGGING="true"
    python -m src.main
    ```

Logs will be saved to `~/.photosort_logs/photosort_app.log`.

## Future Enhancements (Ideas)

* **Enhanced Search Capabilities**:

  * Search by color labels and custom tags
  * Saved search presets
* **Sort/Order by Rating**: Implement functionality to sort or reorder images directly based on their assigned star ratings.
* **AI-Driven Exposure Analysis**: Introduce a feature to detect and flag images with potentially good or problematic exposure (e.g., under/overexposed).
* **Automated Best Shot Selection in Clusters**:
  * Within similarity clusters, automatically suggest or select the "best" image(s).
  * Criteria could include: lowest blurriness score, optimal exposure, AI composition analysis, no one with eyes close etc.
* **Advanced AI Object/Scene Detections & Grouping**:
  * **Car Model Recognition**: Identify and allow grouping by specific car models in photos.
  * **Face Recognition/Clustering**: Detect faces and group photos by the people present.
* **Side by Side** Select Multiple images and see them side by side, with zoom lock etc.
* **Video Support**
