# Parallel Rotation Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds parallel processing to PhotoSort's batch rotation operations, providing significant performance improvements for rotating multiple images simultaneously.

## Changes Made

### 1. AppController (`src/ui/app_controller.py`)
**Method**: `_apply_approved_rotations()` - Used for auto-rotation suggestions

**Before**: Sequential processing - each image rotated one after another
**After**: Parallel processing using ThreadPoolExecutor

**Key Changes**:
- Added `_rotate_single_image_worker()` function for individual image processing
- Replaced sequential for-loop with ThreadPoolExecutor
- Maintains all existing error handling and progress reporting
- Uses optimal worker count: `min(os.cpu_count() or 4, 8)`

### 2. MainWindow (`src/ui/main_window.py`)
**Method**: `_rotate_selected_images()` - Used for manually selected images

**Before**: Sequential processing with user confirmation dialogs during processing
**After**: Parallel processing with pre-validation of lossy rotation requirements

**Key Changes**:
- Added `_rotate_single_selected_image_worker()` function for individual image processing
- Pre-validates which files need lossy rotation and handles user confirmation upfront
- Uses parallel processing for multiple images, sequential for single images
- Preserves all existing UI feedback and error handling

### 3. Bug Fixes
**File**: `src/core/image_pipeline.py`
- Fixed PIL.ImageQt import issues for compatibility with newer Pillow versions
- Changed `ImageQt(pil_img)` to `toqpixmap(pil_img)` calls

## Performance Improvements

Based on testing with 17 sample images:
- **Sequential Processing**: 5.20 seconds
- **Parallel Processing**: 1.16 seconds  
- **Improvement**: ~4.5x faster

The performance gain scales with:
- Number of images being processed
- Available CPU cores
- I/O characteristics of the storage system

## Technical Details

### Worker Function Pattern
Both implementations follow the same pattern:
```python
def _worker_function(file_path: str, ...) -> Tuple[str, bool, str, bool]:
    """
    Returns:
        (file_path, success, message, is_lossy)
    """
```

### Optimal Worker Count
Uses the same pattern as existing parallel operations in the codebase:
```python
num_workers = min(os.cpu_count() or 4, 8)
```

### Error Handling
- Each worker handles its own exceptions
- Failed operations don't affect other parallel tasks
- Comprehensive logging maintained
- Final success/failure statistics reported

### User Experience
- Progress reporting shows real-time completion status
- User confirmation dialogs handled before parallel processing begins
- All existing keyboard shortcuts and menu actions preserved
- Loading overlays and status messages maintained

## Compatibility

- **Thread Safety**: Rotation operations work on individual files, so parallel processing is safe
- **UI Responsiveness**: Progress updates happen as tasks complete
- **Memory Usage**: Worker count limited to prevent excessive resource usage
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality preserved

## Testing

The implementation includes:
1. **Performance Test**: Demonstrates parallel vs sequential timing
2. **Structure Test**: Validates correct function signatures and imports
3. **Logic Test**: Ensures existing functionality is preserved

Both tests can be run independently to validate the implementation.
