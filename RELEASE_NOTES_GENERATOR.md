# OpenAI Release Notes Generator - Implementation Summary

## What was implemented

A complete CI solution that automatically generates release notes using OpenAI when a new release is published.

## Files created/modified

1. **`.github/workflows/release-notes-generator.yml`** - GitHub Actions workflow
2. **`scripts/generate_release_notes.py`** - Python script for OpenAI integration
3. **`tests/test_release_notes_generator.py`** - Comprehensive tests
4. **`requirements-dev.txt`** - Added OpenAI dependency
5. **`scripts/README.md`** - Documentation

## How it works

### Trigger
- Workflow triggers on `release: published` event
- Runs when someone creates a release through GitHub UI or API

### Process
1. **Checkout repository** with full git history
2. **Install dependencies** including OpenAI client
3. **Generate release notes**:
   - Find previous release tag
   - Get git diff (commits + file changes) between releases
   - Send to OpenAI GPT-4o-mini with specific prompt
   - Fallback to basic notes if OpenAI fails
4. **Update GitHub release** with generated notes
5. **Save notes as artifact** for backup

### Features
- ✅ Smart categorization (🚀 New Features, 🐛 Bug Fixes, etc.)
- ✅ User-friendly language translation from technical commits
- ✅ Graceful fallback when OpenAI unavailable
- ✅ Handles first releases (no previous tag)
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Cost-optimized (uses GPT-4o-mini)

## Setup required

1. **Add OpenAI API key** as repository secret:
   - Go to Repository Settings → Secrets → Actions
   - Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your OpenAI API key

2. **Test the workflow**:
   - Create a release through GitHub UI
   - Workflow will automatically run and update the release notes

## Example output

Instead of basic commit messages, users will see:
```markdown
## Release v1.0.1

### 🚀 New Features
- Enhanced UI with frameless dialog windows for a cleaner user experience
- Improved dialog styling and confirmation prompts

### 🔧 Improvements  
- Updated window management for better desktop integration
- Refined visual appearance of system dialogs

## Testing

The implementation includes:
- Unit tests for all core functionality
- Mocked OpenAI API calls for CI testing
- Fallback behavior testing
- Git operations testing
- Full lint and format compliance

## Cost considerations

- Uses GPT-4o-mini (~$0.15 per 1M tokens)
- Typical release notes cost < $0.01 per generation
- Only runs on actual releases (not every commit)
